To understand tuned frequency, pay attention to the Tune indicator: if module is successfully tuned, indicator turns green. If module is currently performing frequency tuning, the same indicator turns red. If indicator is off, selected frequency is not being used. To tune in to such frequency, press Set button when selected.
